I've been obsessed with figuring out the fastest and easiest possible way to learn new skills for the last decade. After years of teaching people and reading the research on this, I've stumbled across a mistake that guarantees an almost 100% failure rate in learning any skill.  

Sadly, this is a mistake that most people make every single day. I call this mistake **Theory Overload**, and I believe it is one of the most important things to understand when trying to learn any new skill.  

But first, we must recognize a crucial, often overlooked ingredient in learning that enables us to acquire skills in the first place—**experiential cycling**.  

For example, if I practice shooting this bow every day for a month, I should get better, right?  

Maybe. But maybe not.  

Once I let go of this arrow, I cannot control its path midair—at least, as far as I know. Where the arrow lands depends entirely on everything I did in the setup beforehand.  

And by the way, just like learning any skill, the process of learning itself follows the same principle. Our exam results, our memory, and our depth of understanding all depend on the processes we used while studying.  

Now, imagine I shot this arrow, and it landed here—not very good. To improve next time, I need to understand **what** to change in order to hit the center.  

I cannot keep firing arrows randomly, expecting to improve. Sure, I might hit a bullseye once in a while, but without consistency. And once the target moves farther away, that strategy won’t work anymore.  

The same applies to learning. If we get a poor exam result, we need to identify **what** to adjust. Just because we perform better in a different exam doesn’t necessarily mean we've solved the problem.  

This is the essence of the **experiential cycle**:  
1. We have an experience.  
2. We observe the outcome.  
3. We reflect on what needs to change.  
4. We experiment to see if our adjustment improves the result.  

Without this cycle, we cannot truly learn any new skill.  

This seems straightforward and obvious. But here’s the trap that holds people back—whether it’s learning a new skill, learning how to shoot an arrow, or learning how to learn itself:  

**The fastest way to learn any skill… is to learn more slowly.**  

This is the **Theory Overload Trap**.  

Most of you know I have a program that helps people learn more efficiently. Unlike YouTube, where I can only explain concepts, my program allows me to **observe** how students behave and track their progress closely.  

Take a look at these two students, and guess which one ended up being more academically successful:  

- **Suresh**, who was in the program for 5 weeks and completed **31%** of the course.  
- **Enzo**, who was in the program for 54 weeks and completed only **20%** of the course.  

Who do you think improved the fastest?  

Surprisingly, despite covering **less** of the course, Enzo achieved better academic results. He went from a baseline score of **62%** to a latest exam score of **92%**.  

On the other hand, Suresh actually got worse! He started at **80%**, but after five weeks, his score dropped to **71%**.  

Why did Suresh get worse?  

Here’s a clue: It’s **not** just because Enzo had more time to study.  

The answer is **Theory Overload**.

### Understanding Theory Overload  

Now, imagine this bowl represents your **brain**—very smooth. (Just kidding!)  

Your brain has **limited cognitive resources**, similar to how a computer has limited memory or RAM.  

Let’s say these wooden blocks represent your **mental capacity**. Whenever we learn something new, it consumes resources:  

- *Hold the arrow more tightly.*  
- *Stabilize my core.*  
- *Keep my shoulders relaxed.*  
- *Breathe more slowly.*  
- *Aim slightly lower.*  

As you can see, my bowl—my **cognitive capacity**—is filling up.  

Additionally, simply **performing the skill** itself takes up resources. Over time, as skills become habits, they require fewer cognitive resources. But when learning something new, the process feels **awkward, difficult, and unfamiliar**—demanding even more mental effort.  

Eventually, we **overload** our brain’s capacity.  

In cognitive research, this is called **multiple element interactivity**—the brain struggling to process too many things at once. This leads to **cognitive overload**, preventing real learning.

### Cognitive vs. Physical Learning  

Unlike learning a physical skill—where we burn energy using our muscles—learning a cognitive skill **burns effort with our brain**.  

This means that just **understanding new information, processing it, organizing it, and remembering it** takes a **huge amount** of cognitive resources.  

If we didn’t exert this effort, we wouldn’t **retain** any information. This is called **passive learning**—where nothing truly sticks.  

On the other hand, **active learning** demands effort, but if we push beyond our limits, we hit **overload** and stop improving.

### The Best Way to Learn a New Skill  

So, what’s the best approach?  

When learning a new skill—especially a **cognitive** skill—we should **only focus on experimenting with one or two things at a time**.  

Suresh covered 30% of the program in a month. This means he was exposed to **over a dozen new techniques**, each requiring two or three elements to focus on.  

In other words, he was juggling **20–30 things** at once.  

As a result, his brain was completely overloaded, preventing real learning.  

This is **exactly** why some students struggle for months or even years—feeling like they’re making no progress. No matter how much time they put in, they **don’t improve**.  

It’s incredibly frustrating.

### The Secret to Learning the Right Way  

Here’s the key:  

**Always balance new theory with practice.**  

- If you practice **without any theory**, it’s aimless.  
- If you practice **with too much theory**, you get overloaded.  

The trick is to balance new knowledge with your **existing skills** until they become habits.  

When a skill becomes a habit, the brain **optimizes** it—requiring fewer cognitive resources. Eventually, what once required intense concentration becomes effortless.  

Now, we free up mental space to take in **new** theory and turn **those** into habits.  

Some skills take **weeks** or even **months** to become habits. Others may take only a few **hours**.  

By balancing **theory** with **practice**, we achieve **optimal** skill growth—practicing in a way that’s **focused, directed, and free from overload**.

### How to Apply This in Practice  

Let’s say you have **5 hours per week** to practice.  

That’s **not enough** to form habits quickly, so you must **limit the amount of new theory** you take in. Because both **practice and theory** are low, they remain **aligned**, allowing for **optimal** learning.  

Now, imagine you **increase** your available practice time to **20 hours per week**.  

Since you’re practicing **more**, you can also **increase** the amount of theory you absorb—proportionally.  

As a **rule of thumb**, I recommend:  
- **1 hour of theory for every 5 hours of practice.**  

For example:  
- **5 hours of practice → 1 hour of theory.**  
- **20 hours of practice → Up to 4 hours of theory.**  

However, learning isn’t just about **time**—it’s about **habit formation**.  

The real key is to **monitor how quickly** new skills become habits. When they do, we create **mental space** to take in new theory and **continue the learning cycle**.  

By following this approach, we **avoid overload**, stay **consistent**, and **actually improve**—**faster than ever**.
