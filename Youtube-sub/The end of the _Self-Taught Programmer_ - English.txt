so I have some unfortunate news for

everyone um the days of learning HTML

CSS JavaScript and Landing a 100K a year

job within 6 months are sadly over but

to be honest I'm not sure they ever

existed in the first place however the

point is uh Landing a job as a self-

toop programmer is becoming exceedingly

more difficult than it has ever been in

the past the landscape of the tech

industry has significantly changed ever

since I got my first job uh back in

2016 matter of fact when I got my first

programming job back in

2016 I didn't have much experience and I

certainly didn't have like a killer

portfolio to show anybody um the extent

of my experience included some classes

that I had taken in high school and some

really crappy Java applications that I

had written but somehow someway I still

managed to land a part-time coding job

with relatively no effort now granted I

did land this job through a string of

connections I made which kind of just

goes to show how powerful networking can

be but still if I were trying to get a

job in this market with the amount of

experience I had back in 2016 I would

probably have a better chance at winning

the lottery because the reality is the

market is just terrible right now I had

someone recently reach out to me who had

just finished their computer science

degree they had uh done an internship at

meta but they were significantly

struggling to just get call backs from

recruiters so if people with degrees and

with experience working at Big tech

companies are struggling you can only

imagine how hard it is for those people

who were told by influencers like me

that it's possible to get a job in

programming without a college degree and

to be clear I'm not trying to scare you

if if you are self-taught you can still

break into the industry but it's

important that we acknowledge that the

industry is in a pretty rough spot right

now layoffs are happening left and right

and a lot of developers are struggling

to find jobs and while I do believe that

the market will get better I'm not

entirely convinced that it will ever

return to its previous levels which is

why I say you will have to work

significantly harder than what you would

have done in the past to compete with

all the other competition out there and

when I say all the other competition I

don't have any statistics to back the

idea that the market is

oversaturated but it does feel a bit

oversaturated okay I mean with all the

coding boot camps turning out grads

every 10 months and all the influencers

promoting learning how to code and with

all the hype around computer science

over the past few years it feels like

the supply of developers has gone way up

meaning that if you want to break into

the industry you will have to do things

to really stand out from everyone else

so what do I mean by this well simply

put you're going to have to have the

type of experience that employers are

looking for from the get-go so I want to

walk through an example with you let's

take a look at the average entrylevel

developer job posting so this is for a

full stack entry-level react developer

position

and these qualifications are generated

from Google because they're stripped

directly from the original job posting

now right off the bat the first thing

you may notice about this entry-level

posting is that they want two years of

experience which mind you is something

that isn't an atypical ask for entry

level positions nowadays and with proper

laying out of your resume you can look

like you have 2 years of experience even

if you spent those two years learning

this is something that we'll go over in

a minute other than that you will see

that you need experience with JavaScript

react Redux HTML CSS rest apis

authentication mechanisms knowing how to

optimize react projects continuous

integration Technologies and agile and

scrum knowledge and then the very last

Point here a computer science degree now

I don't want this to scare you too much

because if you display a high level of

Competency in the above points this can

be overlooked in some instances but the

reality is that if you're competing with

somebody who is equally as good as you

and they have a computer science degree

they're going to get the job which is

why I said in the beginning of this

video you're going to have to do things

that really stand out from all the other

competition so if you really want to

stand out you can look at this job

posting or other job postings like this

one as sort of the recipe for you

getting into the industry now you will

likely never work for this company but

the idea is that we can find job

postings for jobs that we're interested

in and use them as a template for the

type of project we can build that will

help us get another job later down the

road so you can take this text stack and

the processes laid out in this posting

and use this text stack and the

processes to create full stack real

world use case applications okay to

really stand out as a self-taught

developer today it is pivotal that you

display a high level of Competency in

the way that real companies develop real

software so that when you start

interviewing for a company you will look

like the type of candidate that will hit

the ground running and how do you gain

experience into building real world

software as a self-taught developer with

no job experience well you do that by

building real world full stack

applications most product or service

driven companies prioritize the

development and maintenance of full

stack crud applications which is why it

is an extremely safe bet to build these

types of projects by building these

types of projects from the ground up you

will gain a large depth of programming

experience which you can use to create a

beefed up resume so let's run through an

example let's say this is the type of

job I'm going for the one that lists out

all these qualifications the very first

step is to come up with a project idea

and because this is for the sake of

learning this project idea absolutely

does not have to be unique okay so pick

a hobby like reading you can build a

very robust CR app around the idea of

book reviewing book rating sharing books

with friends so on and so forth matter

of fact this idea already exist exist

it's a platform known as Goodreads you

can take good reads build it from the

ground up with a slightly uh tweaked

feature set and then Rebrand it as your

own so for this example let's say we

have our project idea building a good

reads type of application let's go

through how we can gain experience in

the other qualifications listed out in

this posting so first off we'll build

our front end using react typescript and

the Redux Library so we can check off

the these bullet points here and by

using react we'll naturally gain

experience into HTML with jsx which is

similar enough and then we'll also gain

experience into CSS we can gain

JavaScript experience by deploying an

API of some sorts using an AWS service

let's say such as AWS Lambda and because

we'll need some sort of database for our

API to fetch and save data records we'll

create a database maybe something like

mongod DB and and again host it with

Amazon we can Implement some login page

in the app that uses the type of Json

authentication that this job posting

mentions and as for agile and scrum we

can spend a few hours doing some

research into how companies follow scrum

practices and then follow those

practices while creating our portfolio

project matter of fact learning these

agile and scrum practices should be done

before you dive into the creation of

your portfolio project as they are

essentially project management

techniques that can significantly help

you with the overall development of your

project while at the same time giving

you Real World Experience into how

companies use agile to develop their

software and finally we can use

something like GitHub actions to

automatically deploy our release builds

giving us some highlevel exposure to how

cic CD works so in theory we could build

and deploy this application using the

practices I've just mentioned and extend

that over a 6 to 12 month time frame of

coding deploying coding deploying and if

you worked on a full stack application

of this sorts following this plan I've

just laid out for again 6 to 12 months

by adding new features refining existing

features fixing bugs and actually

deploying it to the public Not only

would you gain the type of experience

that real companies value you would have

killer points to mention on your resume

you would have projects that not even

the average computer science student has

on their resume because the thing is

most people list very basic projects on

their resume that they developed within

one to two weeks so as for the resume

here is how you could create an

entry-level developer rume with the

project idea that I've just gone over

now this is a fake resume it's not real

and it should just serve as as an

example or as a model for the type of

resume that you could create so if

you're interested in downloading this

rume head to the link in the description

to sign up for my newsletter and upon

signing up for my newsletter you'll gain

access to download this resume for free

you also gain access to my free ebook 02

full-time programmer in five steps

anyways that is the highlevel overview

of the type of work that you will need

to do to land a job in this market as a

self-d do programmer and even if you're

not a self toop programmer you could

greatly benefit from building these

types of projects anyways thank you for

making it this far in the video and I

will catch you in the next one
