Do you ever get that feeling inside—that you are destined for something more? That a greater life is just waiting to be born?

Perhaps it's a dream you can't stop thinking about, one that, if you were to share with others, they would probably tell you is impossible to achieve.

Maybe that dream is to become an artist, write a book, build a business, move abroad, or finally become the person you were always meant to be. But then, life gets busy. Those dreams of yours get pushed aside, and you find yourself wondering:

How much longer will I avoid doing what I'm capable of, just to continue with what I'm comfortable doing?

If you can relate to this feeling inside and are ready to take action, then please watch until the end—because this video is for you. It found you today for a reason.

We all have something special inside of us—something unique that only you can bring into this world. However, many of us end up rooted in our comfort zones, staying exactly where we are instead of pushing ourselves forward and making changes today for a brighter future.

A friend of mine, who recently turned 40, told me he felt it was too late to start. He said, "I wish I could wake up at 18 again and use my 20s to work on my dreams, without worrying about the opinions of others."

My advice to him? Instead, imagine himself at 90—wishing he could wake up at 40 again, with the opportunity to build the life he wasn't able to before.

The message? It’s not too late to start. It never is.

You might feel afraid when it comes to chasing your dreams. If that’s you, I want you to know—it’s completely normal. It’s easy to doubt yourself; we all do sometimes.

I mean, what if you fail? What if everyone says, "I told you so"?

But... what if—what if you actually succeed?

What if you create a life far greater than anything you ever imagined? Because as Joseph Campbell reminds us:

"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek."

Sometimes, the things we're most afraid of are the very things that will bring us the most joy and fulfillment.

Making changes to your life can feel overwhelming. But you don’t have to change everything at once.

Think big, but start small.

Be consistent. Be patient with the journey.

For as the saying goes: A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

Maybe today, you simply brainstorm some ideas.

Maybe tomorrow, you do some research.

The day after, you reach out to someone for guidance.

Every little step counts.

In fact, if you took just one step forward each day, that would be 365 steps taken in a year.

Just imagine where you could be.

Imagine the person you would become.

It can be hard to believe in yourself—especially when things get tough. But you must be your own cheerleader, your biggest fan. You have to speak to yourself the same way you would to someone you care about deeply.

And I’m here to tell you—you are so much stronger than you think.

You are capable of amazing things.

You're not going to get everything right immediately. No one does.

Everyone makes mistakes. Everyone faces setbacks. I still make plenty of them, and I know I will continue to.

What matters most, however, is how you choose to respond to them.

Because within your response lies your greatest power.

Setbacks can either defeat you—or they can be the lessons you needed to move forward toward something even greater.

There’s a beautiful Japanese saying:

"If you feel like you're losing everything, remember—trees lose their leaves every year, yet they still stand tall and wait for better days to come."

Here’s a thought:

What if every failed relationship, every unsuitable career choice, every bad decision, and every wrong turn—was actually meant to lead you to the life you were destined to live?

And as you pursue your dreams, you will inspire others to follow theirs.

Your courage. Your passion. Your story.

They can be a light for others.

A ripple effect—where you touch lives in ways you can’t even imagine.

One day, perhaps, you will tell the story of this season in your life.

Not as someone who had everything figured out.

But as someone who learned to live with courage—and trust in their own strength.

So if that voice inside you is still whispering that you are destined for more...

Then it’s time.

It’s time to stop waiting and start doing.

It’s time to close the gap between thought and action.

Because when you take steps toward what you want in life—what you want will take steps toward you.

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.

The second-best time? Today.

So I hope that today will be your day.

I hope you finally listen to that voice inside—the one telling you that you are meant for something more.

I hope you don’t let your dreams remain just dreams.

I hope you start making them your reality—and surprise everyone, including yourself, with what you can accomplish.

Because a lot can happen in a year—if you commit to making a change for the better.

My name is Simon Alexander.

Thank you so much for watching.

And I’ll see you in the next video.
