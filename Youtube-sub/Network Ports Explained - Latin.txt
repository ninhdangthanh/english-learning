
**What is a port?** It is a location of this video. A port is not a physical link but a logical connection that programs and services use to exchange information.

Specifically, it determines which software or service the computer should use. Whether a webpage retrieves it, using FTP service, email access, etc.

Ports have unique numbers that identify them, ranging from 0 to 65535. For example, common ports are 80 and 443, which are used for webpages. Port number 21 is designated for FTP, while port number 25 is used for email. A port number is always associated with an IP address.

An IP address is a numerical label that serves as an identifier for a computer or device in a network. Every device must have an IP address for communication purposes. The IP address and port number work together to facilitate data exchange over networks.

For example, if you want to connect to a server over the internet, the IP address is used to determine the geographical location of that server, such as the country, city, etc. The port number determines which service or software you want to use on that server, whether it's a web service, FTP, email, etc.

Now, simply put, what does this all mean? Let’s take the most common port that everyone uses daily, which is port number 80. Port 80 is associated with HTTP, which is used for web pages. Whenever you visit a webpage from your computer, you are using port 80, whether you realize it or not.

Let’s say you sit down at your computer and want to visit the Google homepage. You would open a web browser and then type "google.com" in the address bar. However, before your computer can retrieve the Google page, it must first do two things: it must convert the domain name "google.com" into the corresponding IP address, and also, with the web browser using HTTP, your computer will add port 80 to the IP address.

Now the IP address is used to reach the Google web server. Once the server is detected, the IP address performs its function. At this point, the port number comes into play. It sends a request using port number 80, and the Google web server will respond to your request in the browser. This is how you can finally retrieve the Google webpage. All of this happens behind the scenes.

You don’t see the IP address or port number in use, but there’s a way to see it by using the `netstat` utility. `Netstat` stands for network statistics, and it is a command-line tool used to display network connections and activity on your computer. `Netstat` is available on various operating systems, but in my case, I am working on a Windows computer. So, at the command prompt, you type `netstat`, and then also use the `-n` option to see the port numbers. Then, you press "Enter."

In the output, you can see our connection with google.com. The local address here is our computer’s IP address. Here’s the port number that our computer assigned to this session. The foreign address is google.com. So, we can see the Google server’s IP address along with port number 80 being used for this connection, which, as I mentioned earlier, is used for web pages.

Now let’s talk about the same Google server running an FTP service where clients can transfer files. FTP is a standard protocol used for transferring files between computers and servers over networks and uses port number 21. So, we can open our web browser and enter `ftp.google.com`. Then the same process happens: we’ll see. The domain name "google.com" will be converted to Google’s IP address. And since we are using FTP, our computer will add port 21 to the IP address.

When the Google server sees the incoming request on port 21, it will respond to that request with its built-in FTP service. And if we run the `netstat` command again, it will show the connection with the Google FTP service using port number 21.

As I mentioned at the beginning of this video, port numbers range from 0 to 65535 and are assigned by an organization called the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). These 65,000 port numbers are divided into three categories.

Ports ranging from 0 to 1023 are known as system or well-known ports. These are common ports that most people use daily. Some of these ports I’ve already mentioned, such as ports 80, 443, 25, and 21. Ports ranging from 1024 to 49151 are called user or registered ports. These are ports that can be described by organizations and developers for specific services.

Ports ranging from 49152 to 65535 are referred to as dynamic or private ports. These ports are used by client applications. These are port numbers that your computer temporarily assigns to itself during a session, such as when you browse a webpage.

Of the three categories, two are the most recognized and documented port numbers, which are used on servers. In other words, these are used on servers that connect to our computer. The third category, which is dynamic or private port numbers, pertains to client use, meaning our computer.

This is assigned during a session on our computer. Whenever our computer wants to connect to another computer or server, it assigns itself one of these port numbers.

Sometimes you might see well-known port numbers in use on your computer, like port 21 and port 80. For example, if you run `netstat -an`, you’ll see port 21 and port 80 listening or having an established connection.

Servers, however, are not just large and powerful computers. Your computer can also serve other computers to connect. For example, if you want to run an FTP server on your computer or want to access one, you might see port 21 and port 80 listening or having an established connection because you can configure your computer to act as a server to accept incoming requests.

So, let’s do everything together and take another example. Let’s go and connect our computer to two sites like yahoo.com and example.com. We will also connect to a separate FTP server. Now, if we check the command `netstat -n` again, we will see the output. Here, we see the local IP address of our computer along with the dynamic or private client port numbers used for that session.

Then we see the two IP addresses of the websites our computer is connecting to, using port number 80 for those websites. We also see one FTP site, to which we are connected using port number 21.

Now, if you run this `netstat` command many times, you might see port 443 instead of port 80 in connection to a site. This is because both ports are used for web traffic, but port 80 is for HTTP, which is for unencrypted websites, while port 443 is for HTTPS, with the 'S' indicating security. You can visit pages with HTTPS that have the security feature.

And a lot of websites are now using port 443 instead of port 80. Hey guys, I just want to mention that if you want to increase your knowledge in the networking field or in life in general, I have some audiobooks that I recommend in the description below.
