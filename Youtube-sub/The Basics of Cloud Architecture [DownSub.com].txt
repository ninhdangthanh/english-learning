Why pursue a cloud-based strategy? Well, hardware is expensive. When you go with a cloud provider, you pay much less—sometimes nothing up front—and you gain significant peace of mind. Advantages of migrating to the cloud include affordability: most providers don't charge up front; you'll likely pay as you go. Professional maintenance, compatibility, and upgrades are taken care of for you, and new software deployments can happen much more quickly.

Security is another benefit. Huge cloud providers benefit from economies of scale, especially in security. Data centers can offer the best security beyond what's financially possible for most smaller companies, so you know your data will be safe. Scalability is also crucial; the entire cloud model is based on the principle of only paying for what you need and being able to scale quickly.

This all sounds great, but there are disadvantages to consider as well, including higher long-term costs. While you'll save a lot up front, hosting your software on the cloud often increases your total cost of ownership in the long run. There's also a loss of control; cloud providers are flexible, but a very complex deployment may not be compatible with a cloud configuration. 

Vendor lock-in can be an issue; it can be very difficult to switch providers or take your software off the cloud if you decide to do so. Industry-specific regulations may also pose a challenge. Some cloud-based services might not comply with industry-specific regulations, like HIPAA. Additionally, the physical location of your data is important; you may need to be physically located in a particular region for legal or security reasons. For example, the U.S. government won't store data in Russia. Air gapping is another consideration—if you have very high security needs, you need to ensure the system is air-gapped, meaning it isn't connected to any external networks.

Now, if the company has made the decision to switch from on-premise to cloud-based hosting, there are three strategies to keep in mind:

**Strategy 1: Re-hosting** (also known as "lift and shift"). Here, you simply shift data from on-premise infrastructure to a cloud-based one. This is good for large-scale migrations. Pros include it being a simple and fast process, with many automation tools available to assist. However, cons include that legacy software might not be compatible with this method.

**Strategy 2: Re-platforming** ("lift, tinker, and then shift"). This is re-hosting with some minor tweaks to capture the full cloud benefits. A pro is that you'll be able to capture all the advantages of cloud migration with minimal effort. However, cons include the need for very careful management during re-platforming, as this can easily become a time- and resource-intensive refactoring process.

**Strategy 3: Refactoring** (fully re-architecting applications to suit the cloud). This is often used as a last resort or as a strategic choice, such as when transitioning from a monolithic to a microservice architecture. The pros are that a successful refactoring can lead to increased speed, scalability, and performance. However, the cons are that it is very risky, being the most difficult, expensive, and time-consuming strategy. It can be hugely disruptive to operations if mismanaged.

So, how does this help you with your interviews? If you're interviewing with a major cloud provider, it's helpful to understand the product offerings and how they compare to others. Many companies like to ask system design questions that reflect a real business need, so I recommend spending time learning the landscape of cloud services. If you're interviewing at a company that hasn't yet made the switch to the cloud, the question of on-premise versus cloud might be a good topic to dive into, showcasing your big-picture thinking. If you do go down this path, don't forget to circle back to high-level trade-offs around cost and engineering effort.
