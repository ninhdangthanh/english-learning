1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,200
so I have some unfortunate news for

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,599
everyone um the days of learning HTML

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:13,679
CSS JavaScript and Landing a 100K a year

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,440
job within 6 months are sadly over but

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,279
to be honest I'm not sure they ever

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,760
existed in the first place however the

7
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,240
point is uh Landing a job as a self-

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,199
toop programmer is becoming exceedingly

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,320
more difficult than it has ever been in

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:32,160
the past the landscape of the tech

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,040
industry has significantly changed ever

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,600
since I got my first job uh back in

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,719
2016 matter of fact when I got my first

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,079
programming job back in

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,719
2016 I didn't have much experience and I

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,680
certainly didn't have like a killer

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,399
portfolio to show anybody um the extent

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,600
of my experience included some classes

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,199
that I had taken in high school and some

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,760
really crappy Java applications that I

21
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,760
had written but somehow someway I still

22
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,720
managed to land a part-time coding job

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,520
with relatively no effort now granted I

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,720
did land this job through a string of

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,479
connections I made which kind of just

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,560
goes to show how powerful networking can

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,040
be but still if I were trying to get a

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,320
job in this market with the amount of

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,880
experience I had back in 2016 I would

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,400
probably have a better chance at winning

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,200
the lottery because the reality is the

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,680
market is just terrible right now I had

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,159
someone recently reach out to me who had

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,799
just finished their computer science

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
degree they had uh done an internship at

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,640
meta but they were significantly

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,200
struggling to just get call backs from

38
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,200
recruiters so if people with degrees and

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,960
with experience working at Big tech

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
companies are struggling you can only

41
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,880
imagine how hard it is for those people

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,079
who were told by influencers like me

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,320
that it's possible to get a job in

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,560
programming without a college degree and

45
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,520
to be clear I'm not trying to scare you

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,680
if if you are self-taught you can still

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,680
break into the industry but it's

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,200
important that we acknowledge that the

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,120
industry is in a pretty rough spot right

50
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,040
now layoffs are happening left and right

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,200
and a lot of developers are struggling

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,000
to find jobs and while I do believe that

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,519
the market will get better I'm not

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,959
entirely convinced that it will ever

55
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,120
return to its previous levels which is

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,160
why I say you will have to work

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,800
significantly harder than what you would

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,319
have done in the past to compete with

59
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,840
all the other competition out there and

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,480
when I say all the other competition I

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,560
don't have any statistics to back the

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,680
idea that the market is

63
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,640
oversaturated but it does feel a bit

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,800
oversaturated okay I mean with all the

65
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,519
coding boot camps turning out grads

66
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,080
every 10 months and all the influencers

67
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,760
promoting learning how to code and with

68
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,239
all the hype around computer science

69
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,599
over the past few years it feels like

70
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,000
the supply of developers has gone way up

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,959
meaning that if you want to break into

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,799
the industry you will have to do things

73
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,519
to really stand out from everyone else

74
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,360
so what do I mean by this well simply

75
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,959
put you're going to have to have the

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,400
type of experience that employers are

77
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,200
looking for from the get-go so I want to

78
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,239
walk through an example with you let's

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,760
take a look at the average entrylevel

80
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,319
developer job posting so this is for a

81
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,239
full stack entry-level react developer

82
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,400
position

83
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
and these qualifications are generated

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
from Google because they're stripped

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
directly from the original job posting

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
now right off the bat the first thing

87
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,599
you may notice about this entry-level

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,599
posting is that they want two years of

89
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,360
experience which mind you is something

90
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,239
that isn't an atypical ask for entry

91
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,640
level positions nowadays and with proper

92
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,200
laying out of your resume you can look

93
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,480
like you have 2 years of experience even

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,200
if you spent those two years learning

95
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,799
this is something that we'll go over in

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,439
a minute other than that you will see

97
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:09,840
that you need experience with JavaScript

98
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:12,079
react Redux HTML CSS rest apis

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,280
authentication mechanisms knowing how to

100
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,199
optimize react projects continuous

101
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,239
integration Technologies and agile and

102
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,880
scrum knowledge and then the very last

103
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,639
Point here a computer science degree now

104
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,840
I don't want this to scare you too much

105
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,440
because if you display a high level of

106
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,120
Competency in the above points this can

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,560
be overlooked in some instances but the

108
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,759
reality is that if you're competing with

109
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,160
somebody who is equally as good as you

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,320
and they have a computer science degree

111
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,160
they're going to get the job which is

112
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,280
why I said in the beginning of this

113
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,360
video you're going to have to do things

114
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,960
that really stand out from all the other

115
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,199
competition so if you really want to

116
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,440
stand out you can look at this job

117
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,000
posting or other job postings like this

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,199
one as sort of the recipe for you

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,800
getting into the industry now you will

120
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,560
likely never work for this company but

121
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,240
the idea is that we can find job

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,880
postings for jobs that we're interested

123
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,280
in and use them as a template for the

124
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,039
type of project we can build that will

125
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,120
help us get another job later down the

126
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,520
road so you can take this text stack and

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
the processes laid out in this posting

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,960
and use this text stack and the

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,199
processes to create full stack real

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,160
world use case applications okay to

131
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,680
really stand out as a self-taught

132
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,280
developer today it is pivotal that you

133
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,759
display a high level of Competency in

134
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,600
the way that real companies develop real

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
software so that when you start

136
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,280
interviewing for a company you will look

137
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,000
like the type of candidate that will hit

138
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,160
the ground running and how do you gain

139
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,600
experience into building real world

140
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,080
software as a self-taught developer with

141
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,800
no job experience well you do that by

142
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,440
building real world full stack

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,639
applications most product or service

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,000
driven companies prioritize the

145
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,120
development and maintenance of full

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,759
stack crud applications which is why it

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,360
is an extremely safe bet to build these

148
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,680
types of projects by building these

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,039
types of projects from the ground up you

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,000
will gain a large depth of programming

151
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:26,560
experience which you can use to create a

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,039
beefed up resume so let's run through an

153
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,400
example let's say this is the type of

154
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,039
job I'm going for the one that lists out

155
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,000
all these qualifications the very first

156
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,919
step is to come up with a project idea

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,639
and because this is for the sake of

158
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,319
learning this project idea absolutely

159
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,120
does not have to be unique okay so pick

160
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,160
a hobby like reading you can build a

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,319
very robust CR app around the idea of

162
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,840
book reviewing book rating sharing books

163
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,759
with friends so on and so forth matter

164
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,919
of fact this idea already exist exist

165
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,479
it's a platform known as Goodreads you

166
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,800
can take good reads build it from the

167
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,680
ground up with a slightly uh tweaked

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,560
feature set and then Rebrand it as your

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,919
own so for this example let's say we

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,560
have our project idea building a good

171
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,759
reads type of application let's go

172
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,680
through how we can gain experience in

173
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,800
the other qualifications listed out in

174
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,039
this posting so first off we'll build

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,160
our front end using react typescript and

176
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,840
the Redux Library so we can check off

177
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,000
the these bullet points here and by

178
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,240
using react we'll naturally gain

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,680
experience into HTML with jsx which is

180
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,240
similar enough and then we'll also gain

181
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,639
experience into CSS we can gain

182
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,080
JavaScript experience by deploying an

183
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:50,000
API of some sorts using an AWS service

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,400
let's say such as AWS Lambda and because

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,919
we'll need some sort of database for our

186
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,080
API to fetch and save data records we'll

187
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,639
create a database maybe something like

188
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,840
mongod DB and and again host it with

189
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,440
Amazon we can Implement some login page

190
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,599
in the app that uses the type of Json

191
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
authentication that this job posting

192
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,879
mentions and as for agile and scrum we

193
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,440
can spend a few hours doing some

194
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,400
research into how companies follow scrum

195
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,039
practices and then follow those

196
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,080
practices while creating our portfolio

197
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,840
project matter of fact learning these

198
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,759
agile and scrum practices should be done

199
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,360
before you dive into the creation of

200
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,360
your portfolio project as they are

201
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,839
essentially project management

202
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,360
techniques that can significantly help

203
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,399
you with the overall development of your

204
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,519
project while at the same time giving

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,680
you Real World Experience into how

206
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,760
companies use agile to develop their

207
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,760
software and finally we can use

208
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,399
something like GitHub actions to

209
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,240
automatically deploy our release builds

210
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,360
giving us some highlevel exposure to how

211
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,240
cic CD works so in theory we could build

212
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,959
and deploy this application using the

213
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,000
practices I've just mentioned and extend

214
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,640
that over a 6 to 12 month time frame of

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,240
coding deploying coding deploying and if

216
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,760
you worked on a full stack application

217
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,399
of this sorts following this plan I've

218
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,800
just laid out for again 6 to 12 months

219
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,519
by adding new features refining existing

220
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,240
features fixing bugs and actually

221
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,160
deploying it to the public Not only

222
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,760
would you gain the type of experience

223
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,360
that real companies value you would have

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,760
killer points to mention on your resume

225
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,480
you would have projects that not even

226
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:40,360
the average computer science student has

227
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,560
on their resume because the thing is

228
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:45,880
most people list very basic projects on

229
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,279
their resume that they developed within

230
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,640
one to two weeks so as for the resume

231
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,160
here is how you could create an

232
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,519
entry-level developer rume with the

233
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,040
project idea that I've just gone over

234
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,920
now this is a fake resume it's not real

235
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,360
and it should just serve as as an

236
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,320
example or as a model for the type of

237
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,160
resume that you could create so if

full-time programmer in five steps

245
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,279
anyways that is the highlevel overview

246
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,279
of the type of work that you will need

247
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,800
to do to land a job in this market as a

248
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,320
self-d do programmer and even if you're

249
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,920
not a self toop programmer you could

250
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,880
greatly benefit from building these

251
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,639
types of projects anyways thank you for

252
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,560
making it this far in the video and I

253
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,560
