A few years ago, I began to observe something in my own behavior that made me a bit uneasy.

From the moment I woke up in the morning to the end of the day, my life was a sequence of screens.

I started the day with the very thing that woke me up—my phone. I sat there in bed, watching various cooking videos on Instagram and bouncing between different applications.

Then, it was time to get out of bed and make breakfast. But alongside focusing on the omelet in the pan, I was also glued to the iPad sitting right next to the oven.

Next, it was time to work, so I moved to another screen—one that was attached to yet another screen. Meanwhile, this little nuisance on my wrist kept tapping, beeping, and distracting me as I tried to get important tasks done.

Yet, among all these different devices, one stood out as the worst culprit.

I wasted more time on this one device than anything else: my phone.

I could spend hours on it every single day. So, as an experiment, I decided to practically get rid of it for a month.

I thought, I’m going to limit myself to just 30 minutes a day—maximum.

That was the amount of time I had for maps. The amount of time to call my mother. The amount of time for everything—listening to music, tuning into podcasts, and anything else I wanted to do.

Then, I observed what happened.

It took about a week to adjust to a new, lower level of stimulation. But once I did, three fascinating things occurred.

First, my attention span grew.

I could focus—not effortlessly, but with far greater ease than before.

Second, I had more ideas.

As I moved through the world, especially when my mind wandered, fresh thoughts emerged.

Third, I had more plans and reflections about the future.

All of this stemmed from removing a single device.

Why?

Noticing this shift led me on a long journey to uncover what it truly takes to focus in a world of distractions.

I pored over hundreds of research papers, analyzing them from beginning to end. My office? It looked like one of those crime shows, where a detective has a giant board with strings connecting papers, memos, and newspaper clippings.

I even flew out to meet experts worldwide who study focus. I conducted more experiments on myself. By the end, I had accumulated 25,000 words of research notes on why this phenomenon occurs.

How does technology impact our attention and our ability to concentrate?

Let’s start with attention spans—how we direct our focus and how much control we have over it.

The research is astonishing. It turns out that when working on a computer—especially when our phone is nearby—we focus on a single task for just 40 seconds before switching to something else.

If we have apps like Slack open, that number drops to 35 seconds.

But the reason for this isn’t what we might assume.

We often think the issue is distraction—that our brains simply get sidetracked.

However, after analyzing the research, I realized that distraction is just a symptom of a much deeper problem. The true root cause is overstimulation.

We don’t just get distracted.

We crave distraction.

Our brains are wired to seek out tiny nuggets of new information—whether from social media, emails, or notifications.

In fact, there’s a built-in mechanism in our minds called the novelty bias. It rewards us with a hit of dopamine—the same pleasure chemical we get when eating an entire medium pizza from Domino’s or when experiencing intimacy.

We receive that same dopamine rush when checking Facebook.

So, not only do we crave distractions, but our brain actively rewards us for seeking them out.

That’s the state of our minds today—hyper-stimulated, bouncing from one exciting stimulus to another.

So I wondered, If cutting back on my phone improved my attention span, what if I reduced my overall stimulation even further?

This led me to an experiment.

You know that restless feeling when you go from an intense, busy schedule to suddenly having nothing to do? That sensation has a name: boredom.

I put out a challenge to my website readers:

"What’s the most boring activity you can think of?"

I decided to make myself bored for one hour a day for a month.

Some of the activities I did still make me shudder.

Day 1: I read the iTunes Terms and Conditions for an hour. (It’s actually shorter and more readable than you’d think.)
Day 4: I waited on hold with Air Canada’s Baggage Claims Department. (Pro tip: If you really want to be bored, don’t call reservations—call baggage claims. You’ll wait for hours.)
Day 19: I counted all the zeros in the first 10,000 digits of Pi.
Day 24: I stared at a clock—watching it tick... tick... tick... for one hour.
I completed 27 other mundane activities that month.

And yet—curiously—I noticed the exact same effects as during my smartphone experiment.

Again, it took about a week for my mind to adjust downward into a lower state of stimulation.

This aligns with research showing that it takes about eight days for our minds to fully settle and unwind—like when we’re on vacation. (Side note: Our vacations need to be longer!)

But once I adjusted, my attention span expanded.

I could focus more effortlessly—not because there were fewer distractions, but because my mind was less stimulated, meaning it no longer sought out distractions in the first place.

The most intriguing part? The surge of ideas and plans I had.

Why?

Because my mind had the space to wander.

There’s a quote from J.R.R. Tolkien that I love:

"Not all those who wander are lost."

It turns out, the same applies to attention.

Think about when your best ideas strike.

It rarely happens when you’re deeply focused on something.

Maybe this morning, you were in the shower, and suddenly, an idea clicked.

When we allow our minds to drift, they connect dots in ways we never would have if we were fixated on a screen.

This is what I call "scatter focus."

Research shows that when we let our attention rest, our minds drift toward three main areas:

The past (12% of the time) – mostly recalling ideas.
The present (28% of the time) – working through real-time thoughts.
The future (48% of the time) – planning ahead.
This explains why, when taking a shower, we effortlessly plan our entire day—even though it hasn’t started yet.

This natural inclination is called prospective bias—our brain’s tendency to anticipate the future.

That’s why moments of boredom aren’t a waste.

They’re an opportunity.
