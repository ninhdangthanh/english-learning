finally i get to make this video i've

seen this video being made by many many

tech youtubers and um finally i can make

it because it's been exactly 10 years

that i've been coding

which means from 2012

to

2022 today

year 2012 the year of initiation i

joined the robotics club in school where

we had to build a robot to compete in a

competition called crc i was not a big

fan of manual labor because

using any hand tools would potentially

break my beautiful nails so that was out

of the question there was only one thing

left for me programming the robot's

brain now

i didn't even know what programming was

back then i just read the instructions

and tried to make it work so that we can

control our robot with the joystick

what i used to do that was their own

simplified language called robot c

of course our team won the whole thing

the whole competition but that's also

because we were competing against 14

year olds

and we were 19 at the time so

2012 was also the year i started college

at university of waterloo and i took my

first cs course called designing

functional programs so i wrote code like

this no loops no variables but lots of

recursion so what i learned

no one is too dumb for computer science

year 2013

in 2013 i became a finance wannabe you

have to pronounce it finance not finance

so i was a finance wannabe freshman year

is the year of doing things just to pad

your pitiful resume

you know it i know it

no need to lie to me

my best work experience at this point so

far mcdonald's where i

handled concurrent micro transactions in

a fast-paced environment

so clearly i had to start a side project

and coincidentally i built something

that handled concurrent transactions in

a high speed environment

like i made a trading bot

the site had people betting on events

like whether the gold price would reach

x amount by the end of the week and you

know most people did it for fun and

games but i had to ruin their fun by

actually mathematically modeling the

statistical likelihood of the outcome

and bet on that

i sound smart right

not really i just copied a wikipedia

article because there's a formula

and that's it that's all i did

so did i make money

yes was it luck

absolutely i never even hedged my

positions

now back in university i took elementary

algorithm design and data something like

that where i learned about linked lists

for the first time

and object-oriented programming i took

that course where i learned how to

finally organize my code in classes and

then also i took the class called logic

and computation which i learned

absolutely nothing

all that jazz helped me land an

internship at scotiabank uh doing what

you guessed it automating option pricing

with black shoals model

if that means nothing to you don't worry

it doesn't mean anything to me too

just buzz words

if you do understand good job

no one asked

what i learned you can't rely on others

to just hand you things if you want

something worth getting you'll have to

be proactive or else everyone else would

also have it then

year 2014

computer literacy

this was the year of demystifying

computers i took data structures and

data management

aka how to lead code which is great

because i probably wouldn't be able to

get my next internship

without it if it wasn't for that course

and that next internship was citadel and

holy cow did i learn a lot at citadel uh

because i was clueless right for some

reason i had to build web servers from

scratch in c plus uh i had to implement

web sockets from scratch meaning i had

to construct the data frames with like

opcodes and stuff i was so lost at first

my manager just gave me a networking

textbook and an os textbook so i just

learned enough

just enough to complete my project right

so tcp udp bit manipulation logs and

currency all just to implement some

server and a web interface to display

tiny numbers quickly for traders who

barely look at them

what i learned finally understood how a

simple text file can turn into a program

how bits turn into data and how programs

turn into production ready software

year 2015 that year i finally became a

silicon valley baby boy by landing an

internship at linkedin while i was there

i wrote some c

code that never got deployed and i quote

from

your code was not only useless but it

was toxic it held back our team for a

whole quarter

anyways i got a return offer and a

stellar review great experience five out

of five would do it again

after the internship

i decided to do some research assistant

work for my favorite operating system

professor

i even got my face to be on the paper

totally undeserved so i was sick of

doing the same thing

so i wanted to try some data science so

i went to intern at facebook i learned

sql i learned how to make pretty graphs

i touched mark zuckerberg's hand

and then he put me on a blacklist

um

yeah that's it

basically i don't think i coded at all

maybe a little bit of python scripting

but mostly just sql stuff it was quite

refreshing actually

what i learned

anything is learnable nothing is out of

reach as long as you just sit down be

patient and read from the beginning

i never did distributed systems low

latency networking i never did data

analytics but i just learned

year 2016 rebellion

ah senior year

i took one of the hardest courses in our

school apparently it was called computer

graphics

it wasn't that hard conceptually

it was just a lot of work

basically during the whole course i

rendered so many pictures of balls and

more balls and balls of different colors

balls of different transparency levels

balls of different glossiness

i made dragon balls um so my last

internship was at microsoft

they promised it would be a product

management type job but i ended up just

prototyping windows server security

products using powershell

what i learned

absolutely nothing

nothing

year 2017

passion meets career

so i was on track

to getting a prosperous career in tech

with my resume but somehow between 2016

and

something went terribly wrong and i

suddenly wanted to become a youtuber

so i worked at buzzfeed as a data

scientist hoping that i can appear in

some of their videos

my actual job was to try to understand

facebook videos and how to grow their

facebook pages but at some point they

told me i should stop trying to appear

in so many videos

then i became depressed

because it didn't make me famous

anyway after that

uh i decided to go back to facebook

as a data scientist telling myself that

i will never do youtube again funny how

life works because i did join the

facebook's video creator team

so that was cool

and also

that's when my youtube channel blew up

what i learned the things you learn and

the skills you gain that are completely

unrelated to each other

often actually complement each other

surprisingly

like for example my obsession with

videos

helped me understand the facebook video

platform intimately as a data scientist

which helped my job

year 2018 burnout

i really enjoyed working at facebook

because it was related to videos i live

and breathe video platforms that's me

but i was also growing on youtube a lot

so my focus was split you know i i

didn't stop to think about what i really

wanted in life

i just did things

grew my channel chased numbers and got

burnt out

i didn't quote a single line as a data

scientist

so nothing there

what i learned

one of the best skills to work on in

your life is the ability to be

self-aware and understand yourself

just like coding sports or video games

it all comes down to practice

the more you work on trying to

understand yourself the more you'll be

literate in your own emotions

and having that understanding of

yourself will allow you to make way

better decisions

year 2019 rebirth

so i needed to press reset on my life

and think about

what kind of life i wanted to live

i wanted to chill

so i chose to be a software engineer

i was scared um i haven't coded in so

long and my last software job was in

2015 right my last internship at

linkedin

so i did the typical lee code grind huge

impostor syndrome

applied to two big companies got

extremely lucky and got both offers

i was so so relieved so much of my

mental health quickly got better

basically

year 2020 disillusionment

i never worked as a software engineer

full-time so i thought i would have to

really work hard to play catch-up

but then i learned that everyone else

was as clueless as i was coincidentally

once again i was mostly working in c

plus plus

same thing every time i know i did a lot

of infra work even though i was in a

product team but i also did a lot of

analysis as well

because it was a product team so you had

to do analysis to kind of justify your

projects

to see if it's even worth pursuing

so for stuff like that

the fact that i came from facebook as a

data scientist it really came in handy

and

and also my presentations were always

beautiful because i used to be a data

scientist

what i learned

in the end work is just work your

technical abilities and your expertise

don't matter as much as you think what

matters more is your grit

and just if you can get stuff done

so just be a doer and make things you're

proud of and the rest will come

coding youtube filmmaking it doesn't

matter they're all the same

you're building something

year 2021

moving on

this year my youtube channel became

pretty big i can't really call it a

hobby anymore but um the crazy thing is

i'm loving it more than ever before

and the craziest thing is

i wanted to be a youtuber when i was

like 15

and it actually came true

i am so grateful that i have this

youtube channel

it gives me so much flexibility allows

me to express myself creatively

and it gives me access to some pretty

impressive people in the tech world

all because i make silly videos on the

internet right

it's crazy to think that i probably

wouldn't have made it as a youtuber if

it weren't for my coding videos

if it weren't for me being a programmer

so i got really really lucky

i am very lucky

but i also worked hard

so what i've learned

there are lots of ways to be successful

and also success is defined differently

for everyone

a good rule of thumb

is to pursue projects and opportunities

that you can learn from

that you can grow from

because in the end successful outcomes

are pretty much luck

so if you want to succeed it's a numbers

game like rolling the dice

so keep rolling the dice you can't

control the outcomes of your dice rolls

but you can control what dice you use

and the more you work on yourself the

more the dice become weighted to your

advantage

so eventually you'll hit jackpot as long

as you keep rolling the dice

you'll achieve success whatever that

means

for you specifically

anyways that's it for the video

see ya
