You know, something really interesting happened to me recently that made me think about identity and change.

Your actions don't follow your identity; your identity follows your actions. Let me paint a picture for you, and I'm sure many of you can relate to this scenario.

Someone who wants to become healthy goes all in, right? They buy expensive equipment, tell everyone about their new lifestyle—I mean, they even get the perfect workout clothes. But here's what typically happens: three weeks later, they're right back to their old habits.

Now, this brings up a fascinating question, and I really want you to think about this with me—why does this happen?

Well, what I've discovered is that they tried to change their identity first. They basically attempted to force it. But—and this is crucial—identity just doesn't work that way.

Think of your brain like a detective; it's constantly watching what you do, not what you say. Every tiny action—and I mean every single one—sends a signal: "This is who I am." Do something once, and your brain just sees it as a fluke. Twice, and it starts to notice an interesting pattern. Three times—that's when something magical happens. Your brain goes, "Oh, wait a minute. This must be part of who they are."

Start microscopically small—so small it feels almost silly. Like, if you want to become a reader, don't do what I initially did and declare, "I'll read 50 books this year." Instead, just read one page every day. Just one.

Let me break down what actually happens in your brain—it's pretty incredible when you think about it. Your brain notices, "Interesting, we read today." Tomorrow, another page—"Huh, we're doing this again." Day three—"Wait a minute, are we becoming a reader?"

This is what I call the Identity Loop in action, and honestly, it's beautiful in its simplicity. Small, consistent signals reshape your self-image, which then makes those actions feel more natural, which strengthens your self-image even more. No willpower needed. No massive declarations. Just tiny, strategic actions that add up to massive change.

This works for any change you want to make. But there's a catch—you have to start smaller than your ego wants to. Way smaller. Your ego screams for dramatic change; your brain whispers for consistency.

And in this battle, drawing from years of observation, the brain always wins.

### Chapter 1: Brain Plasticity and Change

Your brain changes every single day, and you get to decide how it changes. Pretty incredible, right?

Think of your brain like a garden. Every thought you have, every action you take, every habit you repeat—they're like creating trails in that garden. When you walk the same path over and over, it becomes clearer, wider, and easier to travel. Just like the path I take to my coffee machine every morning—trust me, that one's well worn.

But wait, it gets even more interesting. Your brain has no idea whether these paths lead to flowers or weeds. It just does what it's designed to do—"Hey, we use this path a lot, better make it stronger."

It's kind of like how my brain automatically knows the route to my favorite coffee shop, even though maybe I should be heading to the gym instead.

Remember how we talked about tiny actions building identity? Well, this is exactly why it works. Every time you take that small action—and I mean every single time—you're not just doing something, you're literally rewiring your brain. Pretty cool, right?

Those old patterns you have—you know, those limiting beliefs and habits you're not super proud of? They're just paths too. And here's the good news—you can let them grow over. But—and this is really important—not by fighting them. Instead, we're going to build new paths.

When you try to stop a habit, your brain actually focuses on it even more. It's like, "Okay, quick experiment with me—don't think about pink elephants." What are you thinking about right now? Pink elephants, right? Don't worry, it gets us every time.

So, here's what we do instead. Instead of fighting the old path, focus on building the new one. Want to stop checking your phone first thing in the morning? Don't fight that urge—that just makes your brain think about your phone even more. Instead, build a new morning routine. Maybe it's drinking water, stretching, or taking three deep breaths—whatever works for you.

Every time you take that new path, something incredible happens. You're not just creating a habit; you're literally building new neural connections. And that old path? It starts to fade—not because you fought it (fighting it actually makes it stronger)—but because you simply stopped maintaining it. Kind of like how the route to my previous job gradually faded from my mind once I started working from home.

This is the real secret to lasting change. You don't have to wage war with your old self—you just have to consistently build new paths, one tiny step at a time. Your brain will do the rest. It's literally designed for this.

If you're curious about how this has worked for you before, think about any habit you've successfully changed in the past. By the way, I'd love to hear about it in the comments below.

### Chapter 2: Environmental Design Mastery

Now that we understand how our brain creates and strengthens new pathways, let's explore how to make this process virtually automatic through our environment.

The smartest way to change your life isn't what most people think. Stop relying on motivation. Stop counting on willpower. Instead, let's talk about something way more powerful—your environment.

Take a moment and do something with me. Look around your room right now. Everything you see is either pushing you toward your goals or pulling you away from them. You actually have complete control over this.

Let me use a simple example from nature. Think about water. Water always follows the path of least resistance, right? It always flows downhill. And here's the thing about your behavior—it works exactly the same way.

Want to eat healthier? I used to think it was all about willpower—trying to resist those late-night cravings. But here's what actually works—don't stock up on willpower, just stop buying junk food. Because let me tell you something I've learned through experience—at 10 p.m., when you're tired and stressed, willpower is gone. But you know what still works perfectly? The fact that there's no junk food in your house.

I call this the Friction Principle. It's pretty simple, really—make good habits downhill and bad habits uphill.

Want to exercise more? Put your workout clothes right by your bed. Want to stop mindless social media scrolling? Delete the apps—make it take three extra steps to access them.

Remember how we talked about brain patterns earlier, naturally connecting concepts? Well, your environment is basically a physical version of those patterns. Change the environment, and you automatically change the patterns.

Studies show that people who keep a fruit bowl visible eat 70% more fruit. Think about that for a second—no willpower needed, no motivation required—just smart environmental design.

It's exactly what happened when I put a water bottle on my desk. Suddenly, I was drinking way more water—without even thinking about it.

Once you understand this principle, you can design success triggers everywhere. Want to read more? Put books on your coffee table—it’s what finally got me reading consistently. Want to drink more water? Put water bottles at every spot you typically sit.

Your environment is like an invisible force field that's always influencing your behavior. Once you set it up right, it works 24/7—even when you're tired, stressed, or completely unmotivated.

I'd love to hear in the comments what environmental changes have worked for you, or what changes you're planning to make after learning this.
