1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,200
finally i get to make this video i've

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,000
seen this video being made by many many

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,719
tech youtubers and um finally i can make

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
it because it's been exactly 10 years

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,960
that i've been coding

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,640
which means from 2012

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,320
to

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,240
2022 today

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,800
year 2012 the year of initiation i

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,680
joined the robotics club in school where

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,720
we had to build a robot to compete in a

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,680
competition called crc i was not a big

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,000
fan of manual labor because

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,200
using any hand tools would potentially

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,440
break my beautiful nails so that was out

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,760
of the question there was only one thing

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,360
left for me programming the robot's

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,280
brain now

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,600
i didn't even know what programming was

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
back then i just read the instructions

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,399
and tried to make it work so that we can

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,719
control our robot with the joystick

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
what i used to do that was their own

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,960
simplified language called robot c

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,119
of course our team won the whole thing

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
the whole competition but that's also

27
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,760
because we were competing against 14

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,799
year olds

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,080
and we were 19 at the time so

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,360
2012 was also the year i started college

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,360
at university of waterloo and i took my

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,840
first cs course called designing

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,040
functional programs so i wrote code like

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,439
this no loops no variables but lots of

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,040
recursion so what i learned

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,200
no one is too dumb for computer science

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,360
year 2013

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,320
in 2013 i became a finance wannabe you

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,119
have to pronounce it finance not finance

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,439
so i was a finance wannabe freshman year

41
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,520
is the year of doing things just to pad

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,439
your pitiful resume

43
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
you know it i know it

44
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,040
no need to lie to me

45
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
my best work experience at this point so

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,680
far mcdonald's where i

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,000
handled concurrent micro transactions in

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,640
a fast-paced environment

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,439
so clearly i had to start a side project

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,439
and coincidentally i built something

51
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,119
that handled concurrent transactions in

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,280
a high speed environment

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,520
like i made a trading bot

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,000
the site had people betting on events

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,560
like whether the gold price would reach

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
x amount by the end of the week and you

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,440
know most people did it for fun and

58
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,920
games but i had to ruin their fun by

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,400
actually mathematically modeling the

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
statistical likelihood of the outcome

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
and bet on that

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,239
i sound smart right

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,959
not really i just copied a wikipedia

64
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,800
article because there's a formula

65
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
and that's it that's all i did

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,720
so did i make money

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
yes was it luck

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
absolutely i never even hedged my

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,519
positions

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,080
now back in university i took elementary

71
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,640
algorithm design and data something like

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
that where i learned about linked lists

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,239
for the first time

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,160
and object-oriented programming i took

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,480
that course where i learned how to

76
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,400
finally organize my code in classes and

77
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
then also i took the class called logic

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
and computation which i learned

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,720
absolutely nothing

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,159
all that jazz helped me land an

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,640
internship at scotiabank uh doing what

82
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,480
you guessed it automating option pricing

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
with black shoals model

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
if that means nothing to you don't worry

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,560
it doesn't mean anything to me too

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
just buzz words

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,560
if you do understand good job

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,200
no one asked

89
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,440
what i learned you can't rely on others

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,519
to just hand you things if you want

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,159
something worth getting you'll have to

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
be proactive or else everyone else would

93
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,840
also have it then

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
year 2014

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,480
computer literacy

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,799
this was the year of demystifying

97
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
computers i took data structures and

98
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,959
data management

99
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,200
aka how to lead code which is great

100
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
because i probably wouldn't be able to

101
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,680
get my next internship

102
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,200
without it if it wasn't for that course

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:07,120
and that next internship was citadel and

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,200
holy cow did i learn a lot at citadel uh

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,360
because i was clueless right for some

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,959
reason i had to build web servers from

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,759
scratch in c plus uh i had to implement

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,040
web sockets from scratch meaning i had

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,160
to construct the data frames with like

110
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,240
opcodes and stuff i was so lost at first

111
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,280
my manager just gave me a networking

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,880
textbook and an os textbook so i just

113
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,720
learned enough

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,759
just enough to complete my project right

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,720
so tcp udp bit manipulation logs and

116
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,280
currency all just to implement some

117
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,240
server and a web interface to display

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,560
tiny numbers quickly for traders who

119
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
barely look at them

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,080
what i learned finally understood how a

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,199
simple text file can turn into a program

122
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,560
how bits turn into data and how programs

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,759
turn into production ready software

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,320
year 2015 that year i finally became a

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,360
silicon valley baby boy by landing an

126
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,720
internship at linkedin while i was there

127
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,680
i wrote some c

128
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,919
code that never got deployed and i quote

129
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
from

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,560
your code was not only useless but it

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,360
was toxic it held back our team for a

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,360
whole quarter

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,639
anyways i got a return offer and a

134
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,720
stellar review great experience five out

135
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,320
of five would do it again

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
after the internship

137
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,039
i decided to do some research assistant

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,240
work for my favorite operating system

139
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,400
professor

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,800
i even got my face to be on the paper

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,880
totally undeserved so i was sick of

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
doing the same thing

143
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,919
so i wanted to try some data science so

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,320
i went to intern at facebook i learned

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,639
sql i learned how to make pretty graphs

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,120
i touched mark zuckerberg's hand

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,479
and then he put me on a blacklist

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,080
um

149
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,840
yeah that's it

150
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,520
basically i don't think i coded at all

151
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,080
maybe a little bit of python scripting

152
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,759
but mostly just sql stuff it was quite

153
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,199
refreshing actually

154
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,840
what i learned

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,560
anything is learnable nothing is out of

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,440
reach as long as you just sit down be

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,520
patient and read from the beginning

158
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,919
i never did distributed systems low

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,880
latency networking i never did data

160
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,479
analytics but i just learned

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,800
year 2016 rebellion

162
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,720
ah senior year

163
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,639
i took one of the hardest courses in our

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,759
school apparently it was called computer

165
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,080
graphics

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,400
it wasn't that hard conceptually

167
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,000
it was just a lot of work

168
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,639
basically during the whole course i

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,120
rendered so many pictures of balls and

170
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,600
more balls and balls of different colors

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,759
balls of different transparency levels

172
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,720
balls of different glossiness

173
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,520
i made dragon balls um so my last

174
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,919
internship was at microsoft

175
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,479
they promised it would be a product

176
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,639
management type job but i ended up just

177
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,800
prototyping windows server security

178
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,960
products using powershell

179
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,199
what i learned

180
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,520
absolutely nothing

181
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
nothing

182
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,000
year 2017

183
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
passion meets career

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
so i was on track

185
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,160
to getting a prosperous career in tech

186
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,840
with my resume but somehow between 2016

187
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
and

188
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,520
something went terribly wrong and i

189
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,919
suddenly wanted to become a youtuber

190
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,319
so i worked at buzzfeed as a data

191
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,840
scientist hoping that i can appear in

192
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,880
some of their videos

193
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,639
my actual job was to try to understand

194
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,440
facebook videos and how to grow their

195
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
facebook pages but at some point they

196
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,759
told me i should stop trying to appear

197
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,599
in so many videos

198
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,319
then i became depressed

199
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,240
because it didn't make me famous

200
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,960
anyway after that

201
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,360
uh i decided to go back to facebook

202
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,599
as a data scientist telling myself that

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,560
i will never do youtube again funny how

204
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,520
life works because i did join the

205
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,280
facebook's video creator team

206
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,560
so that was cool

207
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,840
and also

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,240
that's when my youtube channel blew up

209
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,639
what i learned the things you learn and

210
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,479
the skills you gain that are completely

211
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,360
unrelated to each other

212
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,199
often actually complement each other

213
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,440
surprisingly

214
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
like for example my obsession with

215
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320
videos

216
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,200
helped me understand the facebook video

217
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,039
platform intimately as a data scientist

218
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
which helped my job

219
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,519
year 2018 burnout

220
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
i really enjoyed working at facebook

221
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,800
because it was related to videos i live

222
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,320
and breathe video platforms that's me

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,720
but i was also growing on youtube a lot

224
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,279
so my focus was split you know i i

225
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,800
didn't stop to think about what i really

226
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
wanted in life

227
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
i just did things

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
grew my channel chased numbers and got

229
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,839
burnt out

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,959
i didn't quote a single line as a data

231
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,560
scientist

232
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
so nothing there

233
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
what i learned

234
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,240
one of the best skills to work on in

235
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,800
your life is the ability to be

236
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,600
self-aware and understand yourself

237
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,000
just like coding sports or video games

238
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,680
it all comes down to practice

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,080
the more you work on trying to

240
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,320
understand yourself the more you'll be

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
literate in your own emotions

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,560
and having that understanding of

243
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,720
yourself will allow you to make way

244
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,600
better decisions

245
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,880
year 2019 rebirth

246
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,080
so i needed to press reset on my life

247
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,880
and think about

248
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,320
what kind of life i wanted to live

249
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,800
i wanted to chill

250
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,920
so i chose to be a software engineer

251
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,480
i was scared um i haven't coded in so

252
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,440
long and my last software job was in

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,480
2015 right my last internship at

254
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
linkedin

255
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,880
so i did the typical lee code grind huge

256
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
impostor syndrome

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,720
applied to two big companies got

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,600
extremely lucky and got both offers

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,000
i was so so relieved so much of my

260
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,200
mental health quickly got better

261
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
basically

262
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,640
year 2020 disillusionment

263
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,959
i never worked as a software engineer

264
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,079
full-time so i thought i would have to

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,240
really work hard to play catch-up

266
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,760
but then i learned that everyone else

267
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,560
was as clueless as i was coincidentally

268
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,680
once again i was mostly working in c

269
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,560
plus plus

270
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,640
same thing every time i know i did a lot

271
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,640
of infra work even though i was in a

272
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,399
product team but i also did a lot of

273
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,560
analysis as well

274
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,800
because it was a product team so you had

275
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
to do analysis to kind of justify your

276
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,640
projects

277
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,480
to see if it's even worth pursuing

278
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,079
so for stuff like that

279
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
the fact that i came from facebook as a

280
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,079
data scientist it really came in handy

281
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,880
and

282
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,959
and also my presentations were always

283
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,160
beautiful because i used to be a data

284
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,600
scientist

285
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
what i learned

286
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,320
in the end work is just work your

287
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,800
technical abilities and your expertise

288
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,040
don't matter as much as you think what

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,000
matters more is your grit

290
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,800
and just if you can get stuff done

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,760
so just be a doer and make things you're

292
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,320
proud of and the rest will come

293
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
coding youtube filmmaking it doesn't

294
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
matter they're all the same

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,240
you're building something

296
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
year 2021

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
moving on

298
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,519
this year my youtube channel became

299
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,800
pretty big i can't really call it a

300
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,760
hobby anymore but um the crazy thing is

301
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,680
i'm loving it more than ever before

302
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,079
and the craziest thing is

303
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,680
i wanted to be a youtuber when i was

304
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,240
like 15

305
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,240
and it actually came true

306
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
i am so grateful that i have this

307
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
youtube channel

308
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,639
it gives me so much flexibility allows

309
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,880
me to express myself creatively

310
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,720
and it gives me access to some pretty

311
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,399
impressive people in the tech world

312
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
all because i make silly videos on the

313
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,880
internet right

314
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,200
it's crazy to think that i probably

315
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,680
wouldn't have made it as a youtuber if

316
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,440
it weren't for my coding videos

317
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,440
if it weren't for me being a programmer

318
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,760
so i got really really lucky

319
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
i am very lucky

320
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,399
but i also worked hard

321
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
so what i've learned

322
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,959
there are lots of ways to be successful

323
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,560
and also success is defined differently

324
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,079
for everyone

325
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,000
a good rule of thumb

326
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,519
is to pursue projects and opportunities

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,440
that you can learn from

328
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,200
that you can grow from

329
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
because in the end successful outcomes

330
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
are pretty much luck

331
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,440
so if you want to succeed it's a numbers

332
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,519
game like rolling the dice

333
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,519
so keep rolling the dice you can't

334
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,320
control the outcomes of your dice rolls

335
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,320
but you can control what dice you use

336
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,079
and the more you work on yourself the

337
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
more the dice become weighted to your

338
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,800
advantage

339
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,959
so eventually you'll hit jackpot as long

340
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,200
as you keep rolling the dice

341
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,079
you'll achieve success whatever that

342
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,440
means

343
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,320
for you specifically

344
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,560
anyways that's it for the video

345
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,560
see ya
