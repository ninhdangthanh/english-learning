What is ACID
1. Atomicity
Definition: A transaction is treated as a single unit of work; either all its operations are performed, or none are. If any part of a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
How PostgreSQL Ensures Atomicity:
Transaction Logs: PostgreSQL uses the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to record changes before they are applied. If a transaction fails, the WAL allows it to roll back to a consistent state.
Rollback Mechanism: Any errors or explicit rollbacks (ROLLBACK statement) undo all changes made by the transaction.
2. Consistency
Definition: Ensures that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another, preserving all defined rules, constraints, and relationships.
How PostgreSQL Ensures Consistency:
Constraints: Ensures foreign key, primary key, unique, and NOT NULL constraints are maintained.
Triggers: Custom logic can be enforced to maintain business rules.
Data Types: Strict enforcement of data types prevents invalid data entries.
3. Isolation
Definition: Transactions operate independently and do not interfere with each other, preventing concurrency issues like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, or phantom reads.
How PostgreSQL Ensures Isolation:
MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control): Each transaction operates on a snapshot of the database, ensuring consistency even in highly concurrent environments.
Isolation Levels: PostgreSQL offers Read Committed, Repeatable Read, and Serializable to balance performance and isolation needs.
4. Durability
Definition: Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and survive system failures (e.g., crashes or power loss).
How PostgreSQL Ensures Durability:
WAL (Write-Ahead Logging): Ensures that committed changes are recorded to disk before the transaction is finalized.
Checkpoints: Periodically writes all in-memory changes to the data files on disk.
Crash Recovery: Uses WAL during recovery to ensure that committed transactions are applied and uncommitted transactions are discarded.

ACID IN ACTION
Suppose you’re transferring money between two bank accounts. The ACID properties ensure:
Atomicity: Both the debit and credit happen together or not at all.
Consistency: Account balances remain valid (e.g., no overdrafts unless allowed by rules).
Isolation: Other transactions do not see intermediate states (e.g., debit without credit).
Durability: Once committed, the changes are permanent and can’t be lost.

PostgreSQL Optimizations for ACID
Asynchronous Commits: Allows faster commits by relaxing some durability guarantees, suitable for non-critical operations.
Full Page Writes: Ensures consistency during crashes by recording entire pages in the WAL.
Locking and MVCC: Balances concurrency and isolation using fine-grained locks and snapshots.

ACID and Real-World Reliability
E-commerce: Ensures no payment is deducted without an order confirmation.
Banking: Guarantees accurate transfers, even in the event of system failures or concurrent operations.
Inventory Systems: Prevents overselling or double reservations of products.
ACID ensures PostgreSQL is a reliable choice for applications requiring strict data consistency and integrity.

Levels of Isolation in PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL offers the following transaction isolation levels, balancing data consistency and performance:
Read Committed (Default):
A query sees only committed data at the start of execution.
Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
Repeatable Read:
A transaction sees a consistent snapshot throughout its lifetime.
Prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
Serializable:
Transactions behave as if they are executed sequentially.
Prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.
Common Anomalies in Isolation
Dirty Reads:
Reading uncommitted changes made by another transaction.
Prevented by Read Committed or higher isolation levels.
Non-Repeatable Reads:
The same query returns different results within a transaction due to another transaction's updates.
Prevented by Repeatable Read or higher.
Phantom Reads:
A query returns different rows in subsequent executions due to inserts/deletes by other transactions.
Prevented only by Serializable.
Row and Table Locking in PostgreSQL
FOR UPDATE:
Locks rows for exclusive access, preventing other transactions from modifying or reading them with locks.
Ensures that a transaction can both read and update/delete locked rows.
FOR SHARE:
Locks rows for shared access, allowing multiple transactions to read them.
Prevents updates or deletions by other transactions while the lock is held.
Comparison:
FOR UPDATE: Only one transaction can both read and modify.
FOR SHARE: Multiple transactions can read, but none can modify.
Summary
ACID ensures robust transaction management.
Isolation levels dictate how transactions interact with one another, with trade-offs between performance and data consistency.
Common anomalies, such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, are controlled by choosing the appropriate isolation level.
PostgreSQL provides row-level locking mechanisms, like FOR UPDATE and FOR SHARE, to prevent conflicting operations in concurrent transactions.
